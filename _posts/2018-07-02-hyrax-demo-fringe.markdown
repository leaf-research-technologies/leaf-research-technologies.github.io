We've created a demo instance of Hyrax for Repository Fringe 2018:

Anyone familiar with EPrints testdata might recognise the content of the repository - a migration of a test EPrints to Hyrax.

The migration uses an open source EPrints - Hyrax importer available via our [leaf_addons](https://github.com/leaf-research-technologies/leaf_addons) gem.

Come and talk to Rory, Michele or Julie if you want to know more.
