The Research Technologies team at CoSector - University of London is pleased to announce the release of a new plugin for REF2021 for Eprints repositories, with funding from Goldsmiths University of London.

Thanks to Goldsmiths, who permitted the plugin to be released as open source, it is now available for all customers and the wider community via [https://github.com/eprintsug/ref2021](https://github.com/eprintsug/ref2021) .

**Andrew Gray**, Academic Services Librarian at Goldsmiths, commented:
*“The development and use of the new REF plug-in has been crucial in our preparation for REF2021. This development has been the result of a close and fruitful collaboration with CoSector”*. 

Developed by CoSector’s Senior Digital Repository Specialist Rory McNicholl, and based on the REF2014, this version of the plugin now has integration for OA compliance. 

Key features include:
* Benchmarks – ability to conduct one or more trial runs of your submission as well as the final run; 
* Assign UoA Champions – assign champions to oversee allocated units so they can check and verify submissions; 
* Submit on behalf of other users; 
* REF1 Profile Information – create an enhanced profile to generate the REF1 report; 
* Identify REF2 Outputs – individual staff taking part in the REF submission may select their outputs for submission, providing additional key information for the panel to consider; 
* REFCC integration – the compliance indicator from the REF Compliance Checker is shown when selecting outputs; 
* Record REF4 Data – store data about degrees awarded and research income for each unit of assessment.
