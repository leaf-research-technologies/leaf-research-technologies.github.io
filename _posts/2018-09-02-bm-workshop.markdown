On Monday 2nd September, Steph Taylor (Senior Consultant, Research Technologies Team, CoSector) and Chris Awre (Head of Information Services, University of Hull), ran a workshop at [Museums and Digital Memory](https://www.digitalpreservation101.com/), a one-day conference held at the British Museum.

The workshop explored how to begin to scope out requirements for a repository system, based on the collaborative work carried out as part of a project at the University of Hull to create a digital archive for Hull City of Culture. CoSector, in partnership with Cottage Labs, are providing the technical development for the project.

Slides from the talk are available online:
