2. make sure you are logged in and have edit rights for the reposoitory
3. go to the _posts folder
4. Click 'Create new file', the filename must begin with the date in the form `2018-06-20` (this is the date posted, it doesn't have to be today) and must end with `.markdown`. Keep the title short and sweet, separate words with dashes, eg. `2018-06-20-ref2020-plugin.markdown`

### Format of the post

#### Header

The file must have a header section like so:

```

date:   2018-06-20 12:45:00 +0100

```

The date must be the same date as used in the filename.
You can add any categories. Use a 'general' category for the first, and a more specific one for the second (optional). The second will be nested within the first.

* eprints plugins - will create eprints/plugins folders
